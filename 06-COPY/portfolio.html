    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Warm Neutrals" - A calming, professional palette using off-white, beige, slate, and a subtle indigo accent for focus points. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A narrative-driven, single-page application. The core is an interactive vertical timeline ("The Journey") that visually represents the user's skill progression. This is more engaging than a static list and directly supports the core narrative of growth. Clicking a project on the timeline reveals details in a modal, keeping the main view clean. The structure is: Hero -> About -> The Journey (Interactive Timeline) -> Skills (with visualization) -> Contact. This flow guides the user from who the person is, to what their story is, to what they can do. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Project progression -> Goal: Show growth over time -> Viz/Method: Interactive JS Timeline -> Interaction: Click to open modal with details -> Justification: Visually compelling, reinforces narrative, encourages exploration. Report Info: Skill categories -> Goal: Give a quick overview of capabilities -> Viz/Method: HTML/CSS tag cloud + Chart.js Radar Chart -> Interaction: Hover effects + visual summary -> Justification: The tag cloud is scannable, while the radar chart offers a high-impact "wow" factor summarizing proficiency areas. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                problem: "After proving concepts with manual documentation and procedural scripts, it was clear that a fully declarative, state-managed solution was needed for a true 'one-click' deployment that was both scalable and idempotent.",
                solution: "I engineered a complete, end-to-end automated solution using a declarative IaC toolchain. Terraform (consuming my custom VPC and Security Group modules) provisions the entire AWS infrastructure. Upon creation, a dedicated Ansible server is automatically provisioned via a `user_data` script, which then pulls configuration and roles to declaratively configure all application microservices. This creates a fully automated, repeatable deployment from a bare AWS account to a functional application.",
                challenges_and_learnings: "The key technical hurdle was the seamless, automated handoff from Terraform to Ansible. I iterated on several methods before settling on a `user_data` script that dynamically pulled an Ansible playbook from Git and ran it. This taught me a valuable lesson in bootstrapping configuration management on newly provisioned infrastructure and managing dependencies between Terraform resources.",

                problem: "Hardcoding security group rules within each project's Terraform configuration is not scalable, leads to rule duplication, and makes security policy updates difficult and error-prone.",
                solution: "Following the same principles as the VPC module, I created a dedicated, reusable Terraform module for AWS Security Groups. It allows for defining ingress/egress rules as structured variables, making it simple to attach standardized, well-defined security policies to any resource, ensuring consistency and ease of management.",
                challenges_and_learnings: "I learned how to model security policies as code and the importance of abstracting security rules into reusable modules. This project deepened my understanding of Terraform's module composition and how to create a library of internal IaC components that enforce security best practices by default.",

                solution: "I architected and built a reusable, production-ready Terraform module to provision a secure and scalable AWS VPC. The module establishes a multi-AZ, three-tier subnet architecture (public, private, database), implements a NAT Gateway for secure egress traffic from private subnets, and creates necessary route tables. It is fully configurable via input variables and exposes critical resource IDs as outputs for seamless integration with other IaC components.",
                challenges_and_learnings: "The primary challenge was balancing flexibility with security. I had to decide which parameters should be configurable versus which should be fixed to enforce best practices. This taught me the importance of designing for the '80% use case' while allowing overrides for exceptions. I also learned how to write clear documentation for module variables and outputs, which is crucial for making a module truly reusable by others.",

                solution: "To build foundational automation skills, I authored a suite of shell scripts to automate the setup of the multi-service e-commerce application. This project involved managing components like MongoDB and Redis, providing a deep understanding of the procedural steps that tools like Ansible would later abstract away into a declarative format.",
                challenges_and_learnings: "This project was a masterclass in the limitations of procedural scripting. While faster than manual deployment, ensuring the scripts were idempotent (safe to run multiple times) was a major challenge and highlighted the need for state-aware configuration management tools like Ansible or Terraform.",
